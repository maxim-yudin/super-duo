# super-duo (includes in Udacity Nanodergree)
This is my second project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.

The purpose of this project was to learn and practice these things:

* Diagnose existing issues with an app.
* Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
* Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.
